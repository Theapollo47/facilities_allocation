This is a project designed to determine suitable areas for setting up health care facilities. Criteria considered for this were :

- Proximity to exisiting roads (5km)
- Proximity to other health care facilities (should not be too close or too far)
- Landcover ( see link for legend https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description): In this case I was interested in built up areas and grasslands
- Slope of not less than 2-6 degrees
- Population density

The suitabilty of each criteria is rated on a scale of 0-10 with 10 representing the highest suitability
After making calculations where applicable, Each raster layer is reclassified to reflect the chosen scale of 0-10. 
This is done  to enable compatbility in the later stage of the analysis
